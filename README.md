# SilentTalk - Sign Language Communication Platform

## Project Overview
SilentTalk (SignEase) is a comprehensive platform designed to enable deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to communicate effectively through advanced sign language recognition technology and accessible video conferencing.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Sign Language Recognition**: ML-powered recognition with 85%+ accuracy
- **Accessible Video Conferencing**: Video calls with interpreter view and real-time captions
- **Community Platform**: Forums, resources, and educational content
- **Multi-language Support**: ASL, BSL, and other sign languages

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8.0
- **Database**: SQL Server / PostgreSQL (structured data)
- **NoSQL**: Azure Cosmos DB / MongoDB (flexible data)
- **Authentication**: ASP.NET Core Identity with JWT

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18.x with TypeScript
- **Real-time Communication**: WebRTC + SignalR
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with design tokens

### Machine Learning
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow 2.x / PyTorch
- **Computer Vision**: MediaPipe + OpenCV
- **Architecture**: CNN-LSTM for temporal recognition

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **Platform**: Microsoft Azure / AWS
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage / AWS S3
- **CDN**: Global content delivery
