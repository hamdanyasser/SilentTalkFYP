## Sign Language Recognition

### How It Works

SilentTalk uses AI-powered computer vision to recognize sign language gestures in real-time:

1. **Camera captures** your hand movements
2. **AI analyzes** hand shapes and motions

4. **Speech synthesis** converts to audio (optional)

### Using Sign Recognition

**Enable Sign Recognition:**
1. Join or start a video call
